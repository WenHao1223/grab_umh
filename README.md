# 🦀 Crab - Grab AI Assistant

Crab is a hands-free AI assistant designed specifically for Grab ride-hailing drivers. It enables drivers to focus on driving while accepting or rejecting ride requests through simple voice commands.


## 🎯 Project Pitch

> Imagine you're driving during rush hour and a booking comes in — but instead of scrambling to tap your screen, you simply say "accept" or "reject", and keep driving safely.  
>
> Crab - Grab AI Assistant was built to solve exactly that. It brings voice-first interaction into the Grab experience, creating a seamless, hands-free ride acceptance system powered by AI.
